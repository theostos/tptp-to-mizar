A discovery-style reasoning process, where you explain step by step how one could reconstruct a human-style proof from the machine proof. This reasoning must be enclosed between <think> and </think> tags.\n\n2. The final human-readable proof of the statement, written in Mizar style, enclosed within \\boxed{{ ... }}.
